# Post Your Car

This simple web app allows users to look at cars for sale.  A user is able to sign up/create an account, view cars for sale that were posted by other users, create their own car for sale listings, edit only their own listings, delete only their own listings, and logout.

This is my Second Portfolio Project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering course. This project is focused on using Sinatra with the concepts of MVC and CRUD. 

## Installation

Clone this repo, and type the following:

    $ cd post_your_car
    $ bundle install
    $ shotgun

Shotgun allows you to open the http address in a browser.

Copy and Paste the http address that Shotgun provides you in a brower search bar or Hold the Ctrl key and Click the link.

## Usage

Create an account by typing in a unique username, email, and password. Then add a car for sale listing that you'd like other users to see. 

## License

This app is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
